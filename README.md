The biggest advantage of Dasduino Connect hides within its name. If you ever wanted to connect your development board directly to the Internet, look no further! This Dasduino comes with the ability to connect to Wi-Fi. It even comes with the TCP/IP protocol suite that supports DNS. Connecting the physical world with the Internet has never been easier! Dasduino Connect is based on the well-known ESP8266 microchip which can be a bit complicated to use on its own. Adding the fact that it works from the Arduino IDE, working this board is as simple as it gets.




Dasduino Connect is 63 mm wide and 22 mm high so you can fit it in most projects. It fits perfectly on a breadboard for faster prototyping. It has a total of 30 pins, most of which are digital and one of which is analog. You can simply connect it to your computer with a USB Type-C and program it in Arduino IDE. Connecting the Dasduino Connect with other boards is done with an easyC cable. The design is 3.3V ready with an onboard regulator for 5V. With the JST battery connector, you can make your projects truly wireless. It includes full RGB WS2812B LED as well. Comes without any headers.
